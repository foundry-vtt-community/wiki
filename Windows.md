# Hamachi

Hamachi is a really simple tool which allows you to create a virtual private network which simulates a LAN-type connection that allows other people to connect to you as an alternative if you are unable to port forward. You can download it [here.](https://www.vpn.net)

After installing it it will prompt you to create an account so sort out such formalities.

After that you will be met with this little screen.
