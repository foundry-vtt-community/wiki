One important final setup step is to create and configure the Users who will be joining your game. You should create a User record for each player you expect to join your game. Control of Actors and other permissions are configured at the User level, so having different users allows you to give players access to different content.

This is the Users configuration screen, used to create, edit, or delete User records.

Each user is assigned a permission level which controls what capabilities they will have within the Virtual Tabletop. Additionally each user can have an Access Key which defines a simple password that can be used to restrict access to each User.

**⚠️ Warning ⚠️**
> The Access Keys used in Foundry Virtual Tabletop are NOT cryptographically secure. Please do not reuse any password that you also use for other important accounts or services.

# Permission Levels

## Gamemaster
Users with the Gamemaster permission level have full control over the world and it’s data. Be cautious which users you allow to have GM permission, and it is advisable to assign an access key for any GM players.

## Player
The most basic level of permission. Players can join the game and be given access to control or observe Actors and Items. Basic player accounts do not have some of the permissions which Trusted Players possess.

## Trusted Player
A player flagged as “trusted” has some additional capabilities beyond that of an ordinary player. Trusted players can be allowed access to upload image files to the host’s file system (token artwork, for example). Trusted players are also allowed to place AoE measurement templates on the game canvas.

## Assistant Gamemaster
An assistant GM is similar to a regular GameMaster, they can see the entire game canvas and can create or edit all content. Some permissions are limited, however: Assistant GMs are not allowed to delete Actors, Scenes, or Items.

Even if you don’t have any specific players in mind for your world yet, I recommend creating at least one Player user that you can use for testing out your content from the perspective of a potential player.
