# API
Since Foundry VTT is still in Beta the API is still being ironed out and documentation is light, but there are two major sources to dig into the Foundry API.

## Official API
Atropos has a Developer API Documentation section on the official `foundryvtt.com` website [here](https://foundryvtt.com/api/).

## Forked API
AzzuriteTV#2004 on Discord forked the API using `jsdoc` which can be found on his website [here](https://foundry-doc.azzurite.tv/index.html).
