# Appendix

## Appendix A: Adding an Adventure

**Copy and paste the outline below in writing up new adventures, formatting and all!**
```
## (Adventure Name)

* **Author**: (Put author’s name here, including Discord username. If they accept contributions in code or donations, note this here as well.)
* **Version**: (Note current version of the adventure here.)
* **System Compatibility**: (Note which system(s) of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the adventure is compatible with.)
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: (Note which versions of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the adventure is compatible with.)
* **Translation Support**: (Note which languages are supported, and if they have (full) or (partial) translations.

### Link(s) to Adventure
* (Put a web URL here to find the adventure.)

### Description
(Describe the adventure here. This should include installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the translation should look like file-wise is appreciated, though not required.)

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices

- Links to adventures should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the adventure author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the adventure author deems important. If you have the adventure author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the adventure download link. 
- Adventures are sorted by system compatibility and then alphabetically.
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   
- Ideally, each adventure should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 
- Adventures should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
