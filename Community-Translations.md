# Appendix

## Appendix A: Adding a Translation

**Copy and paste the outline below in writing up new translations, formatting and all!**
```
## (Translation Language)

* **Author**: (Put author’s name here, including Discord username. If they accept contributions in code or donations, note this here as well.)
* **Version**: (Note current version of the translation here.)
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: (Note which versions of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the translation is compatible with.)

### Link(s) to Translation
* (Put a web URL here to find the game system.)

### Description
(Describe the translation here. This should include installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the translation should look like file-wise in the “public/systems/examplesystem” is appreciated, though not required.)
```

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices

- Links to game systems should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the translation author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the translation author deems important. If you have the translation author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the translation download link. 
- Translations are sorted by system compatibility and then alphabetically.
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   
- Ideally, each translation should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 
- Translations should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
