* (The Unnamable) Manual and Source code disclosure (Github):[https://github.com/tadaimatrpg/callofcthulhu](https://github.com/tadaimatrpg/callofcthulhu)
### Description  
This game is a blasphemous game of Cosmic Horror... should be.  
(As far as I know, it's heavily paradise-colored, like Delta Green.)  
As those of you who have been playing for a long time will know,A lot of  
character sheets are lost in the Chaosium campaign.  
So I needed to create a character sheet right away, and I put the Actor sheet in text format.  
Open the JournalEntry "template" in the Compendium and the "Character sheet template" of 7htED.  
There are many reasons for the text method, but one of the big ones is to lose it   
on the spot and write the character sheet right away, eliminating the hassle of  
data entry. You just need to copy and paste the template.  
The other reason is that it's flexible to other supplements   
(because the system itself can be played on 6thED).  
Both the original settings and theattachability are great.  
All that's left is to play the game as usual, with items listed as weapons.  
And the final piece. Version 1.0.0 will complete the system in FVTT version 7 or later.

## Stars Without Number: Revised Edition
* **Author**: [Spice-King](https://github.com/Spice-King)/Spice_King#3128	
* **Version**: unreleased
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.6.0
* **Translation Support**: English, mostly translatable
### Link(s) to Game System
* Coming Soon™ once I have something usable.
### Description
_The year is 3200 and mankind's empire lies in ashes._

_The Jump Gates fell six hundred years ago, severing the links between the myriad worlds of the human diaspora._

_Now, the long isolation of the Silence falls away as men and women return to the skies above their scattered worlds._

_Will you be among them once more?_

Stars Without Number: Revised Edition is an old-school-inspired game of sci-fi adventure, one built from the ground up to encourage sandbox play and simplify a GM's job in providing it. Familiar mechanics are employed to forge new worlds and explore new possibilities, guidelines built on long experience used to help a group venture in wholly new directions.

#### Sheet support and plans
Currently the there is support for the PC character actor sheet, with plans for custom sheets for drones, ships, NPCs, transhuman players, and more. Some support for a small number of item sheets are planned, ranging from armor, weapons to consumables and ship hulls. I hope to have most of the base game content in compendium form from the free edition and I plan to reach out to Kevin Crawford about distribution of the paid content in compendium form in a way that respects his IP once the system is feature complete.

## Tales from the Loop / Things from the Flood
* **Author**: onf#2586
* **Version**: 0.1
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.6.0+
* **Translation Support**: English / Français
### Link(s) to Game System	
* Not available yet
### Description	
In Tales from the Loop, you are playing a kid in an alternative 80s uchrony inspired by the world painted by [Simon Stalenhag](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/). Giant robots are eerily roaming enormous particle accelerators which are driving the world's technological leap, while also being the epicenter of strange mysteries. TFTL is about the ordinary meeting the extraordinary with a sci-fi twist. Government conspiracies, unknown technologies and chilling mysteries coexist with school dramas. 

Things from the Flood expands the timeline of the game into the 90s where player characters grew up to become teens. This extension has a way darker tone, with governments selling their secrets to corporations and technology becoming even more unpredictable and scary.

Being a content light system, making this system is mostly about making it's sheet and some logic for integrated rolls. I don't know yet if TFTL and TFTF will coexist in the same game system or if they are going to be two separate things.

## LANCER
* **Author**: Eranziel (Discord: Eranziel#0410)	
* **Version**: Pre-release	
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: 0.5.x, 0.6.x
* **Translation Support**: English
	
### Link(s) to Game System	
* Coming soon!	

### Description	
In Lancer, players adopt the roles of mechanized chassis pilots - mech pilots - comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Some groups will fight to rectify the crimes of previous administrations; others will fight for their nation,  pieces in a greater game of hegemony. Others will carry the banner of a corpro-state or mercenary company, working to advance private interests while lining their pockets. Others still will fight for groups acting in opposition to those in power - for the underground, for the forgotten, agents of entropy and agents of yet more radical revolutions. 

Lancer is an RPG focusing on tactical mech combat interspersed with narrative pilot-focused beats, set in an optimistic sci-fi future. 

This Foundry system is in development, with an alpha release coming soon(tm). Initial release is planned to include a basic sheet for stat tracking, compendiums of the player-facing options from the core book, and basic macros for weapons and systems.

# Appendix	

## Appendix A: Adding a Game System	

**Copy and paste the outline below in writing up new game system descriptions, formatting and all!**	
```	
## (Game System Name)	
* **Author**: (Put author’s name here, including Discord username. If they accept contributions in code or donations, note this here as well.)	
* **Version**: (Note current version of game system here.)	
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: (Note which versions of Foundry Virtual Tabletop the game system is compatible with.)	
* **Translation Support**: (Note which languages are supported, and if they have (full) or (partial) translations.	
### Link(s) to Game System	
* (Put a web URL here to find the game system.)	
* (Put the manifest url here to update/install the game system.)	
### Description	
(Describe the game system here. This should include the game system’s function, installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the module should look like file-wise in the “public/systems/examplesystem” is appreciated, though not required.)	
---	
```	

## Appendix B: Best Editing Practices	

- Links to game systems should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the game system author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the game system author deems important. If you have the game system author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the game system download link. 	
- Game Systems are sorted by system compatibility, then function, and then alphabetically.	
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing, unless it is the system title, or the module author desires otherwise in the description. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   	
- Ideally, each game system should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 	
- Game Systems should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
