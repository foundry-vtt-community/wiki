# Available markup in chat :
* Dice rolling : `For this, I roll [[1d20]] mid-chat!`, `[[2d20kh]]` (kh = "keep high"), etc.
* Actor references : `Is it a @Actor[Kobold]?`
  Note there must be an _actor_ that exists with that name.  Not just a Compendium entry.
* Item references : `You find an @Item[Abacus].`
  As with actor references, this refers to an item (see item sidebar).  A Compendium entry isn't enough.
